 * About backends
 *
 * The libusbctrl can handle various backends. A backend is a USB driver API.
 * In order to keep the overall libusbctrl (and upper stacks) implementation
 * portable on various hardwares, the libusbctrl provides an abstraction layer
 * which handle renaming and potential overload of driver-level API.
 * This abstraction layer is loaded here, using the system-wide configuration
 * as selector.
 */


/*
 * By now, the libusbctrl only supports the USB OTG HS for STM32F4 plateforms.
 * Feel free to add some more drivers !
 * CAUTION: please, try to write drivers that are as much as possible API
 * compatible with the USB OTG HS driver (its upper API is not HW specific).
 * This will reduce the overload of the abstraction layer.

/*********************************************************************************
 * About handlers
 *
 * The Control plane must declare some handlers for various events (see usbotghs_handlers.c
 * for more informations). These handlers are called on these events in order to execute
 * control level (or potentially upper level(s)) programs. They can use the USB OTG HS
 * driver API during their execution.
 *
 * Control level handlers are linked directly through their prototype definition here.
 *
 * We prefer to use prototype and link time symbol resolution instead of callbacks as:
 *   1. The USB control plane is not an hotpluggable element
 *   2. callbacks have security impacts, as they can be corrupted, generating arbitrary
 *      code execution
 *
 *  WARNING: as we use prototypes (and not callbacks), these functions *must* exists at
 *  link time, for symbol resolution.
 *  It has been decided that the driver doesn't hold weak symbols for these functions,
 *  as their absence would make the USB stack unfonctional.
 *  If one of these function is not set in the control plane (or in any element of the
 *  application to be linked) it would generate a link time error, corresponding to a
 *  missing symbol.
